 a mini omnichord made using Teensy 4.1 and the teensy audio library in arduino

TODO
 - see if theres a way to simplify my chord object because she is complicated
 - see if I can simplify anything else
 - Might be able to make the synthesis more complex?

COMPLETED
 - figured out a way to wrap an oscillator and envelope into a single object.
